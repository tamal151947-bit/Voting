üó≥Ô∏è SimpleVoting Smart ContractOverviewSimpleVoting is a basic, single-round voting application built on the Solidity smart contract language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It enforces a one-person, one-vote rule and allows for easy setup of candidates during deployment.This contract is ideal for learning fundamental Solidity concepts, including structs, mappings, event emission, and access control checks (require).‚öôÔ∏è FeaturesOne Voter, One Vote: Uses a mapping to ensure that a single address can only cast a vote once.Dynamic Candidate Setup: Candidates are defined when the contract is deployed (in the constructor).Transparent Results: Public view functions allow anyone to check the vote count for any candidate at any time.Event Logging: Emits an event upon every successful vote for easy off-chain tracking by front-end applications.üìù Contract DetailsState VariablesVariableTypeDescriptionvotersmapping(address => bool)Tracks which addresses have already voted (true if voted).candidatesmapping(uint => Candidate)Stores all candidates, keyed by their unique ID.candidatesCountuintThe total number of candidates, also used to assign IDs.StructsThe Candidate struct defines the data stored for each person running:Soliditystruct Candidate {
    uint id;
    string name;
    uint voteCount;
}
FunctionsFunctionVisibilityDescriptionconstructor(string[] memory candidateNames)publicDeploys the contract and initializes all candidates based on the array of names provided.vote(uint _candidateId)publicCasts a vote for the specified candidate. Fails if the sender has already voted or the ID is invalid.getCandidate(uint _candidateId)public viewReturns the name and current voteCount for a candidate.EventsEventParametersDescriptionvotedEventuint indexed candidateIdFired when a voter successfully casts a vote.üõ†Ô∏è Deployment and InteractionDeploymentThe contract requires an array of candidate names upon deployment.Example Deployment (using Remix or Hardhat):// Input for constructor:
["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
This will create three candidates with IDs 1, 2, and 3, respectively.InteractionVoting:Call the vote(uint _candidateId) function.To vote for "Bob" (assuming ID 2): vote(2)Checking Results:Call the getCandidate(uint _candidateId) function.To check "Alice"'s current votes (assuming ID 1): getCandidate(1)üõë Security ConsiderationsNo Centralized Control: This contract lacks administrative features. Anyone who interacts with the blockchain can view the results. There is no way to stop or restart the election once the contract is deployed.Gas Costs: Every vote is a transaction that modifies the blockchain state, incurring a gas fee paid by the voter.Simple Identity: Voter identity is based solely on their blockchain address. This makes it susceptible to Sybil attacks if one person controls multiple addresses (though limited by the cost of acquiring/funding those addresses).
