🗳️ SimpleVoting Smart Contract: Decentralized Polling Made Simple


⭐ Overview
The SimpleVoting smart contract is a foundational, immutable voting application engineered in Solidity for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is designed to be a highly auditable and transparent system for simple polls and elections.

Its core mandate is the strict enforcement of the one-person, one-vote rule using blockchain address validation. This contract is an excellent resource for understanding core decentralized application (dApp) principles: data structures, state management, and event-driven architectures.
